# Evan Coleman's personal website ( [ecoleman.me](https://ecoleman.me/) )
**Thanks to [Eddie Colon](https://github.com/coloed3) for helping me with the visual design of the site!**

This is a fun project I'm working to learn a bit of the webdev world.  
Will act both as a living resume, and as a little development / life blog.  

I would like this website to show off my ability to write clean, maintainable, and concise code. This is my second endeavor into the web development space _(my first being a volunteer project [Solarize Pocatello](http://solarizepocatello.org/) which goes live 4/17/19)_. So, every day I learn something new which is one of my favorite things about tech.

## Tech Stack (proposed or already in use):
|              Technology                   |         Use Case      |       Using     |
|:-----------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|:-:|
| [JavsScript](https://www.javascript.com/)  |  Standard Web Dev Language                             | X |
| [React](https://reactjs.org/)              |  Most opular framework, fun to learn                   | x |
| [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)    | For all HTTP calls, currently to grab my Github info!  | x |
| [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)        | DB, different from SQL, so let's learn it!             |   |
| [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)             | Industry standard                                      |   |
| [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/)| Looks like a great testing framework to learn          |   |
| [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)         | Looks like a great successor to Selenium!              |   |
| [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)         | A great C++ successor, can't wait to learn this        |   |
| [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/)               | Framework in Rust to reduce boilerplate for the web    |   |
    
### Methodology:

Having consistent project structure, naming conventions, and general development methodology is very important to me. For this reason, I have done research on best practices in web development, and specifically in React development. From this research, I have a reasonably fleshed out idea of how I want this project to end up like.

### Future Plans:

**I'm working full time, and doing this for fun in my spare time, so when this will get done... I don't know!**
Currently the site is hosted on github pages which is fine for now, but I would like to eventually host it myself likely on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com). Once I have the site hosted, I will be able to begin development on my backend which I would like to write in Rust which will serve up blog posts. I plan on using MongoDB and Redux to handle the storage and state management of the site.
